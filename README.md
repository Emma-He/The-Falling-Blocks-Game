# The Speeding Blocks Game

In this game, your reflex skills will be worked to the MAX! Use the left and right directional arrows on your keyboard (alternatively, you can also use keys"a" and "d" insteand of left and right arrows) to control the movement of the red player block.\

Move the red player block to avoid the grey blocks and catch the yellow blocks. Every grey block will cost you a life, but you can restore your health back by catching a red block. Each yellow block represents 10 points, and for every second you survive in the game, you can also earn one point. Try to earn as many points as possible by collecting yellow blocks and staying alive.\

Have fun and enjoy the game!\

PS* The speed at which the blocks fall will increase over time, so be aware and stay alerted!
